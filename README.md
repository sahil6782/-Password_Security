# Password Strength Evaluation and Security Research

## Task Summary

This project involved creating and testing multiple passwords of varying complexities to evaluate their strength using a password checker tool. Additionally, I conducted research into common password attacks and summarized best practices for creating secure passwords.

### 1. Created Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity
Examples included:
- Simple: `password123`
- Moderate: `Pa55word!`
- Complex: `G7&kLz#1bQw3@Y!`
- Long and Random: `h#T8k%Vqz3pLr9uXb!Dw@M7Zc`

### 2. Used a Mix of:
- Uppercase and Lowercase Letters
- Numbers
- Symbols
- Different Lengths (8 to 20+ characters)

### 3. Tested Passwords Using Strength Checker Tool
Used tools like [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) and [passwordmonster.com](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)

### 4. Collected Feedback and Scores
- `password123`: Weak – Cracked instantly
- `Pa55word!`: Moderate – Cracked in 3 hours
- `G7&kLz#1bQw3@Y!`: Very Strong – Cracked in centuries
- `h#T8k%Vqz3pLr9uXb!Dw@M7Zc`: Extremely Strong – Cracked in trillions of years

### 5. Identified Best Practices
- Use 12+ characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid dictionary words, names, or common patterns
- Use random and unique passwords for each account
- Consider using a password manager

### 6. Tips Learned from Evaluation
- Adding just one symbol or increasing length dramatically improves strength.
- Substituting letters with similar-looking numbers helps but is not sufficient alone.
- Randomness and length are key factors in resisting cracking.

### 7. Researched Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force Attacks: Try all possible combinations.
- Dictionary Attacks: Use a list of common passwords/phrases.
- Credential Stuffing: Reuse of leaked passwords across sites.
- Phishing: Trick users into revealing passwords.

### 8. Summary: Password Complexity & Security
The complexity of a password directly impacts how resistant it is to automated cracking attempts. Longer, unpredictable passwords with varied character types are exponentially harder to crack. Simple or reused passwords are highly vulnerable, especially to dictionary and brute force attacks.

##  Conclusion

Through this task, I validated the importance of using complex, unique passwords and understood how various attack methods exploit weak ones. Implementing secure password habits and utilizing tools like password managers can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
